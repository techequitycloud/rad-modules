# MC_Bank_GKE Module

## Overview

The **MC_Bank_GKE** module deploys a production-grade, multi-cluster microservices banking application on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). It is designed as a comprehensive learning environment for platform engineers who want to gain hands-on experience with advanced GKE capabilities, including multi-cluster networking, service mesh, global load balancing, and cloud-native observability.

The application deployed is **Bank of Anthos** — an open-source, HTTP-based banking simulation built by Google Cloud Platform. It consists of nine microservices written in Python and Java, communicating over a service mesh, and exposed to the internet via a globally distributed load balancer with automatic TLS certificate management.

This module is intended for **educational purposes**. It is not a production banking system. Its value lies in the breadth and depth of Google Cloud and Kubernetes features it exercises simultaneously in a realistic, working application context.

## Architecture Overview

The module creates the following high-level architecture:

```
Internet

    ▼
Global External Load Balancer (Google Cloud)
    │  ┌─ HTTPS redirect (HTTP 301)
    │  ├─ Google-managed TLS certificate
    │  └─ sslip.io dynamic DNS domain
    │
    ▼
Multi-Cluster Ingress (GKE Hub Feature)
    │  ├─ Routes to frontend pods across all clusters
    │  └─ Backed by MultiClusterService
    │
    ├──────────────────────┐
    ▼                      ▼
GKE Cluster 1          GKE Cluster 2
(us-west1)             (us-east1)
    │                      │
    └──── GKE Fleet ───────┘
              │
              ├─ Cloud Service Mesh (ASM)
              ├─ Multi-Cluster Services
              └─ Shared Fleet Config
```

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Multi-region placement**: Clusters are distributed across two GCP regions by default (us-west1 and us-east1). This mirrors a real high-availability deployment where workloads survive a regional failure.

**Single global VPC**: All clusters share one VPC network with GLOBAL routing mode. Each cluster has its own subnet with dedicated secondary IP ranges for pods and services, preventing address conflicts.

**Config cluster pattern**: Multi-Cluster Ingress is configured from `cluster1`, which acts as the configuration cluster. The GKE Hub multi-cluster ingress feature uses this cluster as the authoritative source for ingress configuration and distributes it across the fleet.

**Automatic service mesh**: Cloud Service Mesh is enabled at the fleet level with `MANAGEMENT_AUTOMATIC` mode. GKE manages the control plane, upgrades, and lifecycle of the mesh without manual intervention.

**Namespace as mesh boundary**: The `bank-of-anthos` namespace is labelled with `istio.io/rev=asm-managed` on both clusters, which triggers automatic Envoy sidecar injection into every pod in that namespace.

## GKE Cluster Features

### Autopilot vs Standard Clusters

This module supports both GKE **Autopilot** and **Standard** cluster modes, selectable at deployment time. Autopilot is the default.

| Feature | Autopilot | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Node management | Fully managed by Google | Self-managed node pools |
| Node provisioning | Automatic, per-pod | Manual or cluster autoscaler |
| Pricing model | Per-pod resource usage | Per-node (always-on) |
| Spot/preemptible nodes | Supported via pod config | Spot nodes configured in node pool |
| Workload Identity | Enabled automatically | Must be explicitly enabled |
| Security hardening | Enforced by default | Configurable |
| Best for | Simplicity and cost efficiency | Maximum control and customisation |

In **Standard mode**, this module provisions node pools with the following defaults:
- **Machine type**: `e2-standard-2` (2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM)
- **Disk**: 50 GB SSD (`pd-ssd`)
- **Spot instances**: enabled — nodes are preemptible, reducing cost by up to 80%, appropriate for a learning environment
- **Node count**: 2 nodes per pool, spread across available zones in the region

### Release Channel

Clusters are enrolled in the **REGULAR release channel**. GKE release channels automate cluster upgrades and ensure nodes and control planes stay on a supported, tested version.

| Channel | Update cadence | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| RAPID | Immediately after release | Feature testing, dev environments |
| REGULAR | 2–4 weeks after RAPID | Most production workloads |
| STABLE | 2–4 weeks after REGULAR | Risk-averse, compliance-sensitive workloads |
| EXTENDED | Up to 24 months support | Long-running, infrequently updated clusters |

### Security Posture

Each cluster has **Security Posture** enabled in `BASIC` mode with `VULNERABILITY_BASIC` scanning. This feature continuously evaluates your cluster against security best practices and scans workload container images for known CVEs.

**What Security Posture provides:**
- **Workload configuration auditing**: flags pods running as root, containers without resource limits, missing liveness/readiness probes, and other misconfigurations
- **Vulnerability scanning**: scans container images in running workloads against OS and language package vulnerability databases
- **Actionable findings**: surfaces issues in the GKE Security Posture dashboard with severity ratings and remediation guidance

This is distinct from Artifact Registry vulnerability scanning, which scans images at push time. Security Posture scans *running* workloads, catching drift between what was pushed and what is actually deployed.

### Workload Identity

For **Standard clusters**, **Workload Identity** is enabled. This is the recommended mechanism for granting Kubernetes workloads access to Google Cloud APIs without static service account keys.

**How it works:**
1. Each GKE cluster gets a Workload Identity Pool: `PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog`
2. A Kubernetes Service Account (KSA) is annotated to link it to a Google Service Account (GSA)
3. The GSA is granted an IAM binding that allows the KSA to impersonate it
4. Pods using that KSA call GCP APIs using short-lived tokens — no key files, no secrets

**Why this matters**: Traditional approaches mount a JSON key file as a Kubernetes Secret. If that secret leaks via a compromised pod, the key can be used from anywhere. With Workload Identity, credentials are short-lived tokens issued by GKE's metadata server and are only valid from within the cluster.

In this module, Bank of Anthos uses Workload Identity to send traces to Cloud Trace and metrics to Cloud Monitoring.

### Managed Prometheus

**Managed Service for Prometheus** is enabled on each cluster — Google's fully managed, Prometheus-compatible monitoring solution built into GKE.

**What it provides:**
- Prometheus-compatible metrics collection without deploying or managing a Prometheus server
- Automatic scraping of Kubernetes system components (`kube-state-metrics`, `node-exporter`, `kubelet`)
- Long-term storage backed by Google's Monarch metrics infrastructure
- Query interface via Cloud Monitoring or PromQL
- Out-of-the-box dashboards for cluster health, node utilisation, and workload metrics

The module enables `SYSTEM_COMPONENTS` metric collection by default. Workload-level scraping of custom `/metrics` endpoints requires a `PodMonitoring` or `ClusterPodMonitoring` custom resource.

### GCS FUSE CSI Driver

The **Cloud Storage FUSE CSI driver** is enabled on all clusters, allowing pods to mount Google Cloud Storage buckets as a POSIX-compatible filesystem.

**Use cases in a microservices context:**
- Sharing large static assets (ML models, media files, config bundles) across pods without baking them into container images
- Mounting read-only reference data updated externally (e.g. a bucket populated by a CI pipeline)
- Offloading large write workloads (logs, exports) directly to GCS without a separate sidecar

To use the driver, annotate your service account and reference a GCS bucket in your pod's volume spec. The driver handles mounting, credential negotiation via Workload Identity, and FUSE kernel integration transparently.

### Gateway API

The **Gateway API** is enabled on `CHANNEL_STANDARD`. Gateway API is the successor to the Kubernetes Ingress resource, providing a more expressive, role-oriented model for configuring traffic routing.

| Capability | Ingress | Gateway API |
|---|---|---|
| Traffic splitting | Limited / annotation-based | Native (HTTPRoute weights) |
| Header-based routing | Annotation-based | Native |
| Role separation | Single resource | Separate Gateway + Route objects |
| Protocol support | HTTP/HTTPS | HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, gRPC, TLS |

### Cost Management

**GKE Cost Management** is enabled on all clusters. This feature attributes resource costs (CPU, memory, storage) to Kubernetes namespaces and labels, enabling per-team or per-workload cost visibility within a shared cluster. Cost data is available in the Google Cloud Billing console and exportable to BigQuery.
